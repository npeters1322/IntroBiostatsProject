# Intro Biostats Project
My Introduction to Biostatistics Project

As my first R project, I did a basic exploratory analysis and fit a few logistic regression models to try to find predictors of Michigan State University men's basketball NCAA Tournament outcomes. Although it is not very advanced, it was my first attempt at my own project using R to do data analysis.

The .Rmd file contains my RMarkdown code where I did my analysis and produced an HTML file with results.

The .html file contains my final product.

Data I used came from Kaggle, specifically at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/google-cloud-ncaa-march-madness-2020-division-1-mens-tournament/data.
